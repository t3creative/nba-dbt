# ML Player Points Training Model - Usage Guide

## 🎯 **Overview**
You now have a complete **3-tier ML training architecture** designed for accurate player points prediction. This is the foundation layer of your ensemble betting model.

## 📊 **The Three Models**

### 1. **`ml_player_points_training_v2.sql`** - Main Training Dataset
**Purpose**: Production-ready training data with 60+ engineered features
- **Grain**: One row per player-game
- **Target**: `target_pts` (current game points)
- **Features**: 7 tiers of predictive features from all your feature stores
- **Split**: 2017-18 to 2022-23 = training, 2023-24 to 2024-25 = test
- **Records**: ~100k+ training samples expected

### 2. **`ml_feature_importance_analysis_v2.sql`** - Feature Selection Intelligence
**Purpose**: Identifies which features matter most for prediction accuracy
- Correlation analysis with target variable
- Feature importance rankings (Tier 1-5)
- Multicollinearity detection
- Feature selection recommendations

### 3. **`ml_model_validation_checks_v2.sql`** - Quality Assurance
**Purpose**: Ensures zero data leakage and validates model readiness
- Temporal safety verification (critical!)
- Data quality assessment
- Train/test split validation
- Model readiness scoring

## 🚀 **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Deploy the Models**
```bash
# Run all three models in dbt
dbt run --models ml_player_points_training_v2
dbt run --models ml_feature_importance_analysis_v2  
dbt run --models ml_model_validation_checks_v2
```

### **Step 2: Validate Model Safety** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
```sql
-- Check validation results first
SELECT * FROM ml_training.ml_model_validation_checks_v2 
WHERE validation_category = 'TEMPORAL_SAFETY';

-- Must see ALL "PASS" values:
-- future_data_leakage_check: PASS
-- historical_prior_data_only_check: PASS  
-- temporal_separation_check: PASS
```
**If any validation fails, DO NOT proceed to training until fixed.**

### **Step 3: Analyze Feature Importance**
```sql
-- Get top predictive features
SELECT * FROM ml_training.ml_feature_importance_analysis_v2 
WHERE analysis_type = 'DETAILED_FEATURE_RANKINGS';

-- Get recommended feature sets
SELECT * FROM ml_training.ml_feature_importance_analysis_v2 
WHERE analysis_type = 'FEATURE_SELECTION_RECOMMENDATION';
```

### **Step 4: Export Training Data**
```sql
-- Export for ML training (Python/R/etc.)
SELECT * FROM ml_training.ml_player_points_training_v2 
WHERE is_training_data = TRUE 
  AND feature_completeness_score >= 70;
```

- `situational_favorability_score` - Game situation
- `total_context_multiplier` - Team context boost

### **Tier 3: Opponent Matchups**
- `position_overall_matchup_quality` - Position-specific matchup
- `opp_overall_strength_score` - Opponent strength
- `is_exploitable_matchup_flag` - Favorable matchups

### **Tier 4: Historical Patterns**
- `recency_weighted_pts_vs_opponent` - Head-to-head performance
- `historical_confidence_score` - Sample size quality
- `best_scoring_game_vs_opponent` - Ceiling indicator

### **Tier 5: Advanced Interactions**

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Model Creation**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Validate temporal safety** - Review validation results
2. **Feature selection** - Use importance analysis to select optimal feature set
3. **Export training data** - Get clean dataset for ML model training
4. **Baseline testing** - Train simple models to establish baseline performance

### **Model Training Recommendations**

#### **Recommended ML Algorithms**
1. **Gradient Boosting** (XGBoost/LightGBM) - Best for this feature mix
2. **Random Forest** - Good baseline, handles missing values well  
3. **Neural Networks** - For capturing complex interactions
4. **Linear Regression** - Interpretable baseline

#### **Feature Selection Strategy**
```python
# Start with Tier 1 + Tier 2 features (minimal set)
minimal_features = [
    'pts_avg_l5', 'team_pts_share_l5', 'min_avg_l5',
    'scoring_efficiency_composite_l5', 'rest_advantage_score',
    'position_overall_matchup_quality', 'total_context_multiplier'
]

# Full feature set (all Tier 1-3)
full_features = minimal_features + tier_3_features + selected_tier_4_features
```

#### **Model Evaluation Approach**
```python
# Regression metrics to track
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

# Time-series validation (critical!)
- Walk-forward validation by season
- No data leakage in cross-validation
- Test on 2023-24, 2024-25 seasons
```

### **Integration with Ensemble**
This regression model outputs **predicted points** → feeds into your **classification layer** for over/under decisions:

```python
# Ensemble architecture
Layer 1: Points Prediction (this model) → predicted_points
Layer 2: Classification Model → over/under decision
        Input: predicted_points + additional features + betting line
        Output: binary classification + confidence
```

## 📋 **Quality Checks to Monitor**

### **Data Quality Indicators**
- `feature_completeness_score >= 70` for training samples
- Historical data availability for key matchups
- No extreme outliers (50+ point games handled appropriately)

### **Model Performance Benchmarks**
- **MAE < 6.5** points (strong performance)
- **RMSE < 8.5** points (good variance control)
- **R² > 0.45** (solid predictive power)

### **Temporal Safety Monitoring**
- Regular validation runs to ensure no data leakage
- Feature drift detection over time
- Performance consistency across seasons

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **High Missing Data**
```sql
-- Check missing data patterns
SELECT * FROM ml_training.ml_model_validation_checks_v2 
WHERE validation_category = 'MISSING_DATA_PATTERNS';
```
**Solution**: Increase minimum games threshold or improve feature imputation

#### **Poor Historical Coverage**
**Issue**: Many players have `historical_data_availability = 'NONE'`
**Solution**: Use `pts_avg_l5` as fallback when historical data unavailable

#### **Feature Multicollinearity**
```sql
-- Check correlation issues
SELECT * FROM ml_training.ml_feature_importance_analysis_v2 
WHERE analysis_type = 'MULTICOLLINEARITY_ISSUES';  
```
**Solution**: Remove highly correlated features (correlation > 0.85)
