      The 'feat_opp__opponent_pregame_profile' model provides a comprehensive profile of an NBA team's
      opponent before a game. It includes various statistics such as the opponent's defensive rating, offensive rating,

      rebound percentage, blocks per game, steals per game, field goal percentage, three-point field goal percentage,
      free throw percentage, and turnover ratio. The model also calculates the opponent's average statistics over the
      last 5 and 10 games, as well as for the entire season up to the current game. Additionally, it provides an adjusted
      defensive rating and pace, which default to the season average if the last 5 games' data is not available. Finally,
      the model calculates z-scores for the opponent's defensive rating and pace over the last 10 games, providing a
      measure of how these statistics compare to the season average.
