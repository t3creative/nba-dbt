# MY INITIAL USER PROMPT MESSAGE 

I'd like for you to use the postgres MCP tool to query the raw.player_props postgres database to view the schema for that table. Once you have it I want you to review it thoroughly. The columns, the data types, the rows and what level they are, the values etc.

After you do that, I'd like you to provide me a high level roadmap for the best and most efficient way to take that raw data and transform it throughout our schemas into a rich and valuable set of training ready features for our machine and deep learning algorithms.

we'll be using these to help us in accurately predicting player prop bets, as well as building out the best player prop betting systems and strategies.


# CLAUDE'S RESPONSE IN CURSOR 

I'll query the schema of the raw.player_props table to understand its structure.

{
  "sql": "SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'raw' AND table_name = 'player_props' ORDER BY ordinal_position;"
}

}

[
  {
    "row_count": "3886937"
  }
]

Based on my analysis of the raw.player_props table, here's a comprehensive roadmap for transforming this data into ML-ready features:

## Raw Player Props Data Analysis & Transformation Roadmap

### Schema Overview
The raw.player_props table contains player proposition betting data with:
- Player information (name, team, slug)
- Market details (market_id, market type)
- Betting lines and odds (line, over_odds, under_odds)
- Sportsbook information
- Game dates and event IDs

### Transformation Roadmap

#### 1. Staging Layer (Views)

**Model: stg_betting__player_props_raw**
- Clean and standardize raw data
- Handle null values
- Normalize player names and teams
- Convert odds to probabilities
- Add timestamps for data loading

**Model: stg_betting__player_props_daily**
- Aggregate props by player/game/market
- Calculate consensus lines and odds across sportsbooks
- Identify market outliers (sportsbooks with significantly different lines)

#### 2. Intermediate Layer (Incremental)

**Model: int_betting__player_props_normalized**
- Enhance player identification with consistent player_ids
- Join with game information (opponents, home/away)
- Create implied probabilities from odds
- Calculate edge metrics between sportsbooks
- Track line movement over time

**Model: int_betting__player_props_historical**
- Link props to actual game outcomes
- Calculate historical accuracy metrics
- Track prop performance by market and sportsbook
- Develop baseline hit rates and profitable patterns

**Model: int_betting__player_market_trends**
- Calculate moving averages of lines by player/market
- Identify seasonal trends and patterns
- Analyze how lines adjust based on recent performance
- Track market inefficiencies over time

#### 3. Feature Layer (Incremental/Tables)

**Model: player_game_prop_features**
- Game-specific prop features
- Line consensus and variance
- Market inefficiency metrics
- Historical performance vs. line
- Sportsbook-specific tendencies

**Model: player_market_history_features**
- Player's historical performance vs. specific markets
- Trends by opponent, venue, rest days
- Performance patterns by game context (b2b, injury status)
- Seasonal analysis of prop performance

**Model: team_matchup_prop_features**
- Team defensive metrics against specific prop markets
- Pace and style impact on prop markets
- Coach/system influence on player performance
- Opposition correlation analysis

**Model: market_efficiency_features**
- Closing line value analysis
- Mispriced opportunities identification
- Sportsbook bias indicators
- Optimal timing for market entry

**Model: player_consistency_features**
- Volatility metrics by player/market
- Performance distribution analysis
- Streak analysis and pattern recognition
- Situational consistency metrics

#### 4. Training Models (ML-Ready Tables)

**Model: player_prop_prediction_dataset**
- Aggregated features with historical outcomes
- Feature importance scoring
- Balanced datasets for different market types
- Time-series validation structures

**Model: player_prop_recommender_dataset**
- Value identification features
- Kelly criterion optimized staking
- Expected value calculations
- Market movement prediction signals

### Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with daily incremental builds**
   - Focus on the most valuable prop markets first (points, rebounds, assists)
   - Prioritize high-volume players for initial models

2. **Apply PostgreSQL optimizations**
   - Leverage array_agg for odds collection across sportsbooks
   - Use window functions for trend analysis
   - Implement partitioning by date and market_id

3. **Integrate external data sources**
   - Player injury status
   - Game environments (pace, total points, spread)
   - Recent player performance

4. **Implement specialized tests**
   - Ensure consistent player identification
   - Validate implied probability calculations
   - Check for prop market integrity

5. **Create analysis documentation**
   - Document market-specific characteristics
   - Maintain metrics on prediction accuracy
   - Track ROI by feature set and market

This roadmap will transform the raw player props data into sophisticated ML-ready features while adhering to the project's structure and PostgreSQL optimization requirements.

# NBA Player Props Transformation Roadmap

## 1. Database Schema Analysis

The `raw.player_props` table contains:
- 3.9M+ rows of betting data
- 527 unique players
- 13 distinct markets
- 12 different sportsbooks
- 31 teams
- Date range from Jan 2021 to Mar 2025 (including future games)
- Complete data with no nulls in key fields

## 2. Transformation Framework

### Stage 1: Staging Models

**Model: `stg__betting__player_props`**
- **Materialization**: View (less than 4M rows is manageable)
- **Purpose**: Standardize raw data, fix data types, implement minimal cleaning
- **SQL Approach**:

```sql
with source as (
    select * from {{ source('raw', 'player_props') }}
),

renamed as (
    select
        offer_id,
        event_id,

        case 
            when under_odds > 0 then 100.0 / (under_odds + 100)
            when under_odds < 0 then abs(under_odds) / (abs(under_odds) + 100)
            else null

        source_file
    from renamed
)

select * from final
```

**Model: `stg__betting__player_props_with_timestamps`**
- **Materialization**: Incremental
- **Purpose**: Add timestamp inference from source_file pattern
- **SQL Approach**:

```sql
with source as (
    select * from {{ ref('stg__betting__player_props') }}
    
    {% if is_incremental() %}
        where game_date >= (select max(game_date) from {{ this }})

        -- Assuming format like: /path/player-slug/player-slug_YYYY-MM-DD_odds_[TIMESTAMP].csv
        regexp_replace(source_file, '.*_odds_(.*).csv', '\1') as timestamp_str,
        
        -- Convert to timestamp if pattern exists, otherwise use game_date
        case 
            when regexp_replace(source_file, '.*_odds_(.*).csv', '\1') ~ '^\d{10}$'
            then to_timestamp(regexp_replace(source_file, '.*_odds_(.*).csv', '\1')::bigint)
            else game_date::timestamp 
        end as recorded_at

        player,
        player_slug,
        team,
        market_id,
        market,
        line,
        sportsbook,
        over_odds,
        under_odds,
        over_implied_prob,

        game_date,
        recorded_at,
        source_file
    from with_timestamps
)

select * from final
```

### Stage 2: Intermediate Models

**Model: `int__player_props_normalized`**
- **Materialization**: Incremental
- **Purpose**: Normalize player data, unify team abbreviations with player database
- **SQL Approach**:

```sql

## 3. Feature Engineering Formulas

### Odds Conversion Methodologies

**American to Decimal Odds:**
```sql
case 
  when american_odds > 0 then (american_odds / 100.0) + 1
  when american_odds < 0 then (100.0 / abs(american_odds)) + 1
  else null
end as decimal_odds
```

**Decimal to Implied Probability:**
```sql
(1 / decimal_odds) as implied_probability
```

**American to Implied Probability (Direct):**
```sql
case 
  when american_odds > 0 then 100.0 / (american_odds + 100)
  when american_odds < 0 then abs(american_odds) / (abs(american_odds) + 100)
  else null
end as implied_probability
```

**Removing Vig from Market:**
```sql
-- Calculate total implied probability (with vig)
over_implied_prob + under_implied_prob as total_implied_prob,

-- Calculate fair probabilities (removing vig)
over_implied_prob / (over_implied_prob + under_implied_prob) as fair_over_prob,
under_implied_prob / (over_implied_prob + under_implied_prob) as fair_under_prob,

-- Convert back to American odds
case 
  when (over_implied_prob / (over_implied_prob + under_implied_prob)) < 0.5 
  then ((1 / (over_implied_prob / (over_implied_prob + under_implied_prob))) - 1) * 100
  else -100 / ((1 / (over_implied_prob / (over_implied_prob + under_implied_prob))) - 1)
end as fair_over_odds
```

### Line Movement Calculations

**Time-Weighted Line Movement:**
```sql
-- Calculate time-weighted line movement (more recent changes have higher weight)
sum(
  line_change * (1.0 / (1.0 + extract(epoch from (current_timestamp - recorded_at))/86400))
) / 
sum(1.0 / (1.0 + extract(epoch from (current_timestamp - recorded_at))/86400)) 
as time_weighted_line_movement
```

**Market Sentiment Indicator:**
```sql
-- Positive value: market trending toward over
-- Negative value: market trending toward under
sum(case 
  when line_change > 0 then 1
  when line_change < 0 then -1
  else 0
end * (extract(epoch from (recorded_at - lag_recorded_at))/3600)) / 
sum(extract(epoch from (recorded_at - lag_recorded_at))/3600) 
as market_sentiment_indicator
```

### Market Comparison Metrics

**Sportsbook Line Variance:**
```sql
-- Measure of disagreement between sportsbooks
stddev(line) over (partition by prop_key) as line_variance,

-- Distance from consensus
line - avg(line) over (partition by prop_key) as line_vs_consensus
```

**Value Indicator:**
```sql
-- Positive: potential over value
-- Negative: potential under value
(avg_stat_value - line) / stddev_stat_value as standardized_value_indicator
```

### Historical Performance vs. Line

**Performance Edge:**
```sql
-- Positive: player tends to exceed the line
-- Negative: player tends to fall short of the line
avg(stat_value - line) as performance_edge
```

**Consistency Metric:**
```sql
1 - (stddev(stat_value - line) / avg(stat_value)) as consistency_score
```

### Categorical Encoding Strategies

**Team Strength Encoding:**
```sql
-- Calculate team strength rating by category
rank() over (
  order by avg(defensive_rating) 
) as defensive_rank,

ntile(5) over (
  order by avg(defensive_rating)
) as defensive_quintile
```

**Market Type Encoding:**
```sql
-- Map categorical market to numeric feature
case 
  when market = 'Points O/U' then 1
  when market = 'Rebounds O/U' then 2
  when market = 'Assists O/U' then 3
  when market = 'Threes O/U' then 4
  when market = 'Pts+Reb O/U' then 5
  when market = 'Pts+Ast O/U' then 6
  when market = 'Reb+Ast O/U' then 7
  when market = 'Pts+Reb+Ast O/U' then 8
  when market = 'Steals O/U' then 9
  when market = 'Blocks O/U' then 10
  else 99
end as market_type_encoded
```

## 5. Evaluation Framework

### Cross-Validation Approach

**Time-Series Split:**
```sql
-- Create time-based folds for validation
select
  prop_key,
  player_id,
  market_id,
  game_date,
  ntile(5) over (order by game_date) as fold_number,
  *
from training_data
```

**Feature Importance Assessment:**
```sql
-- Calculate feature importance using correlation with outcome
select
  feature_name,
  corr(feature_value, case when outcome = 'OVER' then 1 else 0 end) as correlation_with_over,
  abs(corr(feature_value, case when outcome = 'OVER' then 1 else 0 end)) as abs_correlation
from model_results
group by feature_name
order by abs_correlation desc
```

### Backtesting Metrics

**ROI Calculation:**
```sql
-- Calculate ROI by market type
select
  market,
  sum(case 
    when prediction = 'OVER' and outcome = 'OVER' then (over_odds/100) 
    when prediction = 'UNDER' and outcome = 'UNDER' then (under_odds/100)
    when prediction = 'OVER' and outcome != 'OVER' then -1
    when prediction = 'UNDER' and outcome != 'UNDER' then -1
    else 0
  end) / count(*) as roi,
  count(*) as sample_size
from backtest_results
group by market
order by roi desc
```

**Edge Detection:**
```sql
-- Calculate edge by prediction confidence level
select
  ntile(10) over (order by prediction_probability) as confidence_decile,
  avg(case when prediction = outcome then 1 else 0 end) as accuracy,
  count(*) as samples
from backtest_results
group by confidence_decile
order by confidence_decile
```
