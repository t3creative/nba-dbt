- **Consistency**: Excellent. All model names follow the same pattern.
- **Observations**: The prefix `stg__` clearly identifies staging models, followed by the entity and stat type.

#### SQL Structure
- **Pattern**: All models use a similar structure:
  1. Config block (materialized as views)
  2. Source CTE
  3. Final CTE with select statement
  4. Final select from the transformation CTE
- **Consistency**: Very good. Structure is identical across models.
- **Enhancement Opportunity**: Consider standardizing the order of columns across models.

#### Field Naming
- **Pattern**: Snake case for all field names
- **Consistency**: Very good. All fields use snake_case.
- **Grouping**: Fields are logically grouped with comments (Primary Keys, Team Identifiers, etc.)
- **Enhancement Opportunity**: Standardize abbreviations (e.g., pct vs percentage, ast vs assist).

#### Field Type Handling
- **Pattern**: Explicit type casting for most fields
- **Consistency**: Good. Most numeric fields have explicit type casts.
- **Enhancement Opportunity**: Consider using dbt's cross-database macros for type casting.

#### Custom Macros
- **Pattern**: Using `extract_minutes` macro and `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key` for consistent processing
- **Consistency**: Excellent. Used correctly across models.
- **Enhancement Opportunity**: Document custom macros in a central location.

### Documentation Analysis
