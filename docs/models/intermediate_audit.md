- `int__player_usage_bxsc.sql`

### Model Structure Analysis

#### Naming Conventions
- **Pattern**: `int__<entity>_<stat_type>_bxsc.sql`
- **Consistency**: Excellent. All model names follow the same pattern as staging models, with 'int' prefix replacing 'stg'.
- **Observations**: The double underscore pattern is consistent with some of the staging models, maintaining cohesion across the project.

#### SQL Structure
- **Pattern**: All models use a similar structure:
  1. Config block (materialized as incremental)
  2. Multiple CTEs for source data and transformations
  3. Final select statement with distinct on clause
  4. Ordering by player_game_key and game_date
- **Consistency**: Very good. Structure is almost identical across models.
- **Strength**: The distinct on clause ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate records.

#### Common CTEs
- **Pattern**: All models include the same set of common CTEs:
  1. `box_scores`: Reference to the corresponding staging model
  2. `league_game_logs`: Extracts game context info from league game logs
  3. `player_game_logs`: Gets season_year information
  4. `parsed_matchups`: Parses matchup strings for home/away and opponent info
- **Consistency**: Excellent. The same pattern is used across all models.
- **Strength**: This approach standardizes context enrichment across all player boxscore models.

#### Field Organization
- **Pattern**: Fields are organized into logical sections with comment blocks:

### Join Strategy Analysis

#### Join Patterns
- **Pattern**: All models use left joins to enrich the base data from staging:
  ```sql
  from box_scores bs
  left join league_game_logs gl on bs.game_id = gl.game_id
  left join parsed_matchups pm on bs.game_id = pm.game_id and bs.team_id = pm.team_id
  left join player_game_logs pgl on gl.game_id = pgl.game_id
  ```
- **Consistency**: Excellent. Join strategy is identical across models.
- **Strength**: The left join approach preserves all boxscore records, even if context data is missing.

#### Key Relationships
- **Pattern**: Consistent use of game_id, player_id, and team_id across joins
- **Consistency**: Very good. Key relationships are maintained consistently.
- **Enhancement Opportunity**: Consider adding error handling for missing related data.

### Transformation Logic
