## Categorical Encoding Methods

| Encoding Type | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|---------------|----------|------|------|
| One-Hot Encoding | Low-cardinality categories (â‰¤10 unique values) | Interpretable, simple | Increases dimensionality |
| Label Encoding | Ordinal categories (e.g., rankings) | Keeps relationships intact | Not for nominal data |
| Target Encoding | High-cardinality, strong correlation with target | Captures relationships | Risk of data leakage |
| Frequency Encoding | High-cardinality categories | Reduces dimensionality | Loses relationship with target |
| Binary Encoding | Moderate-cardinality categories (10-50 values) | Reduces feature space | Less interpretable |
| Embedding Encoding | Deep learning models, very high-cardinality data | Captures complex relationships | Requires training |

| Unit Vector Scaling | Scales each row to unit norm (L2 = 1) | Used when magnitude of features matters | X / \|\|X\|\| (Euclidean norm) |

## Outlier Handling & Missing Value Imputation

### Outlier Detection

| Method | Description | Example Calculation |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Z-Score Method | Flags values that are k standard deviations from the mean | Z = (X - Î¼) / Ïƒ (If \|Z\| > threshold, it's an outlier) |
| Interquartile Range (IQR) | Flags values that fall outside 1.5x IQR from Q1/Q3 | IQR = Q3 - Q1, Outliers if X < Q1 - 1.5*IQR or X > Q3 + 1.5*IQR |
| Percentile Capping (Winsorizing) | Caps values at the 1st and 99th percentile | CASE WHEN X > P99 THEN P99 ELSE X END |
| Domain-Specific Filtering | Removes values based on sports-specific logic | CASE WHEN Minutes < 5 THEN NULL END (e.g., ignore garbage time stats) |

### Outlier Handling

| Method | Description | Example Calculation |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Remove Outliers | If outliers are errors or anomalies | DELETE FROM table WHERE Z > 3 |
| Cap (Winsorize) Outliers | When extreme values skew model performance | UPDATE table SET X = P99 WHERE X > P99 |
| Transform (Log/Power Transform) | When outliers are skewed but important | LOG(X + 1) |
| Treat Separately (Create Binary Flag) | If outliers contain predictive value | CASE WHEN X > P99 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |

### Missing Value Imputation

| Method | Description | Example Calculation |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Mean Imputation | Works for normally distributed data | COALESCE(Points, AVG(Points) OVER ()) |
| Median Imputation | Works for skewed data / outliers | COALESCE(Points, PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) OVER ()) |
| Mode Imputation | Works for categorical features | COALESCE(Position, MODE() OVER ()) |
| Forward Fill (Last Known Value) | Best for time-series (e.g., injuries, rolling averages) | LAG(Points, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY Player ORDER BY Game Date) |
| Interpolation (Linear, Polynomial) | Best for time-series trends | (Next Value + Prev Value) / 2 |
| Regression Imputation | Predict missing values using other variables | Predict missing values using ML model |
| Indicator Variable for Missingness | When missingness itself is predictive | CASE WHEN Points IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS Missing_Flag |
